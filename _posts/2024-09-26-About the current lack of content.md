I'm sorry for the lack of content on this blog. I've been very busy lately and haven't had time to write new posts. I promise to update the blog soon with more interesting content. Thank you for your patience. 

I've been working learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to move the blog from markdown format to a more dynamic website. Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of time to work on it.
So for the time being, I'll keep posting in markdown format. 

Also, I'm continuing to learn about cybersecurity on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) and [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) and started to work on small osint projects like and IP locator and a metadata extractor. I'll post about them when they are ready.
