Raspberry Pis are small, credit card-sized computers that can be used for a variety of projects. They are inexpensive, easy to use, and can be used for a wide range of applications.

I recently, due to different reasons, could not use my main computer, hence I decided to use my Raspberry Pi as my main computer for a while. For this task, I chose a Raspberry Pi 5 with 4 GB of RAM and a 128 GB SD card. And installed the [kalilinux](https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/) operating system on it since I'm interested in cybersecurity. Here is what I learned during my journey:

## 1. Setting up the Raspberry Pi

All you need is a Raspberry Pi, a power supply, an SD card, an SD card reader, an ethernet cable, and a computer to download the [imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) software. The imager software will help you flash the operating system onto the SD card. In my case, I chose Kali Linux.

## 2. my first time using the Raspberry Pi

After setting up the Raspberry Pi, I connected it to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. I was able to boot up the Raspberry Pi and start using it right away.
First, I updated the system by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

After updating the system, I installed some essential tools such as 'Visual Studio Code' and others. After I was done with the setup, I started exploring the Raspberry Pi and its capabilities. One of the first thing you **have** to forget, is using it like a normal computer, it's not as powerful as a normal computer, so you have to compromise on some things. For me it was, surfing the web with a lot of tabs open, and using it for gaming. I solely used it for coding and other light tasks.\
One of the things I liked about the Raspberry Pi is that it is very energy-efficient and does not consume a lot of power. I was able to run it for hours without any issues. Another great thing is the variety of projects you can do with it. You can use it for programming, home automation, and much more. Additionally, the Raspberry Pi has a large community of users who are always willing to help you out if you run into any issues. And finally, its' price is very affordable, making it a great option for anyone who wants to learn more about computers and programming. Not to forget, it's a great tool for learning Linux, since it's very lightweight, flexible, and forgiving (if you mess up, you can always easily reflash the SD card).

Due to its' OS (Operating System) being based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), you won't be able to avoid using the terminal, so you have to get used to it. But don't worry, it's not that hard, and you will get used to it in no time.

## 3. Conclusion

Overall, I have currently nothing but good things to say about the Raspberry Pi. It's a great tool for learning more about computers, programming and Linux. It's a great tool for anyone who wants to learn more about computers and programming or just want to automate some tasks. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in technology and wants to learn more about computers and programming. I will continue to use my Raspberry Pi 5 as my main computer for a while and see how far I can push it.
